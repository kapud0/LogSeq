	- Reference notes are the original text that resonated with you. Other than being useful for citation, capturing them can also give context to what you were thinking, should you return to your notes at a later time. Beau encourages us to capture the whole paragraph but highlight the sentence that resonates to capture the entire idea in essence and give context to the highlight.

	- The first step of Luhmann's Zettelkasten is taking literature notes as you read something. These notes contain what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your writing or thinking. But, you have to be careful that a) it has to be brief to make it easy to review later, and b) you have to write it in your own words. This means no copy and pasting. Writing in your own words may take a while, but it forces you to really understand what they mean.

Go through each note you made in the previous step while thinking about how they relate to what you're learning, your interests, thinking or research. Your goal is not to collect as many notes as possible but to add new values to your existing ideas, arguments and discussions.
